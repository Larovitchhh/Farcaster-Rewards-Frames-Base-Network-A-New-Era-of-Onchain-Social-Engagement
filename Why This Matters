1. Frictionless Onboarding
Frames remove the need for users to leave their feed, connect wallets, or navigate complex dApps. Everything happens in one click.
2. Creator Monetization
Base enables creators to monetize their content directly through Frames — whether it’s selling digital goods, offering subscriptions, or launching tokens.
3. Community Growth
By embedding rewards and interactions into social posts, Farcaster and Base are turning passive scrolling into active participation.
4. Developer Ecosystem
Base supports builders with grants, tools like OnchainKit, and community channels to accelerate Frame development. [www.bitget.com]
