Farcaster Rewards Frames &amp; Base Network: A New Era of Onchain Social Engagement
Frames are interactive mini-apps embedded directly into social posts on Warpcast, the flagship client of the Farcaster protocol. These frames allow users to perform onchain actions — like minting NFTs, making payments, or voting — without leaving their social feed. Think of them as bite-sized dApps that live inside your timeline.
