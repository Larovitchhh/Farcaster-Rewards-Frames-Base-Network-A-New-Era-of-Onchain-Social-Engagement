This site is part of Farcaster’s Rewards Frames initiative — a gamified experience where users can earn rewards (like ETH, NFTs, or social badges) by interacting with Frames. These interactions are powered by Base, ensuring fast and cheap execution of onchain actions.
Examples of Rewards Frames:

Minting NFTs directly from a post
Claiming tokens for participating in a poll or event
Shopping (e.g., Girl Scout Cookies via Coinbase Commerce)
Playing games or completing quests

These experiences are not only fun but also help onboard users into the Web3 ecosystem without the usual friction of wallet connections and dApp navigation.
